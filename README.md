Using Next.js for the frontend, and strapi for the backend.

## Getting started
Want to host a local version? I'm honored, truly.

First thing's first, gotta install the slew of dependencies:
`npm install`

To run the whole thing, give the following a shot:
`npm run develop`

To run just the strapi backend, try this:
`cd backend`
`npm run develop`

To run just the next.js frontend, give this a go:
`cd frontend`
`npm run develop`
